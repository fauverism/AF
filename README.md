[AF] - The Acronym Finder
=========================
A simple web based app used to find acronyms.

Acronyms have been confusing people since the beginning of time. We can pronounce them as a word (NATO) or spoken as each letter (HTML). Most of the time they come across as sounding like gibberish. This web based app hopes to elevate some of that confusion.
